      <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical,
       or material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the
       phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
        The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.
         Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood
          as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>

    <p>The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or
      "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times,
       literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient philosophy, Natura is mostly
        used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which
        originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants,
         animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.</p>

    <p>The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several
       expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core
       applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers
       (this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially  for Heraclitus),
        and has steadily gained currency ever since.</p>

    <p>Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to
       geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living
        plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with
        inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and
         change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.</p>
