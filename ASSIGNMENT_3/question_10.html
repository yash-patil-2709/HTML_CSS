          <p>Electromyography (EMG) signals are always used for clinical
             diagnostic applications regarding nerve and muscle disorders
              that are affecting the link between nerves and muscles.
               These symptoms may include tingling, numbness, or unexplained
                weakness in the limbs. EMG (electromyography) records the
                 electrical activity of our muscles.</p>

          <p>In this report we describe the hardware developed by us
            for sensing EMG signals, amplify them, digitize them under
             the supervision of the microcontroller and send the data
              to the computer for display and further processing.</p>

          <p>Electromyography (EMG) may be a diagnostic technique that
             evaluates the health condition of muscles and therefore
              the nerve cells that control them. These nerve cells are
               known as motor neurons. They transmit electrical signals
                that cause the muscles to contract and then relax. An EMG
                 translates these signals into graphs or numbers, helping
                  doctors to form a diagnosis.</p>

          <p>The doctor will usually order EMG when someone is showing
            symptoms of a muscle or nerve disorder. These symptoms may
             include tingling, numbness, or unexplained weakness in
              limbs. EMG results can help the doctor cure muscle disorders,
               nerve disorders, and disorders affecting the connection between
                nerves and muscles.</p>

            <li><b>Objectives</b><ul>
              <li>The primary objective of this project is to develop the
               electronic hardware and software to acquire EMG signals
                and route them to PC for further processing.</li>

              <li>Understanding and study of different electrodes for picking
                 up the EMG signals</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
            <li><b>Implementation</b><ul>
              <li>The First stage is to study the differential amplifier
                /Instrumentation amplifier according to the need for surface
                 electrodes.</li>
              <li>After designing the instrumentation amplifier the user
                 is given the option to vary the gain according to the need
                  required which is done by another stage of the operational
                   amplifier.</li>
              <li>Performing the simulation of the hardware circuit using
                proteus design suite 8.6</li>
              <li>Once the instrumentation amplifier is built with
                 variable gain, this amplified needs to be stored in the
                  computer which is done using the data acquisition system.</li>

          <hr>
          <p>EMG signal interpretation is a rising and contemporary research
             field today. A lot of research work and analysis has been carried
             out by different scientists in this domain over the last
             70-80 years. Some of the biomedical engineering labs in our
              country also have shown their interests in this research domains
               and started work. Still, ergonomics has not been carried out on
                these research field. Documentation of experiments was beginning
                 with discovering the generation of electricity from the
                 specialized muscle of electric eel by Franesco Redi’s
                  initiative research proposal in 1666. Different scientists,
                   research workers proposed and demonstrated various innovative
                    and artistic articles and objects with an influence of
                     Redi’s work. In 1890, Marey introduced the term ‘electromyography’
                      and its activity behind actual reading. In the short
                      review consideration, it proceeds to conclude that though
                       the particular idea originated from Redi’s work
                       but the term EMG was introduced by Marey.</p>

          <p>Based on the literature review it says that the EMG signals are
             acquired from muscles and they vary from person to person.
              For a healthy person, the EMG signals have more amplitude
               compared to that of an unhealthy person. This EMG signal
                based on the study is reviewed that they are complicated
                 to study for a normal person as it is a random signal.</p>
          <p>The signal obtained at the end of the EMG detector is a processed
             signal and this is not the actual EMG signal generated by the
              body. Due to this, the raw EMG signal generated by our muscles
               is lost and this might cause difficulties in the final
                observation done by the doctor who analyzes the signal in depth.</p>

          <p>Surface electrodes are electrodes that are applied to the skin of
             the person. Surface electrodes are those which are placed in
              contact with the skin of the subject to obtain bioelectric
              potentials from the surface. Surface electrodes are pointed
               on the skin but they do not prick the surface. Surface
               electrodes can be either dry or floating. Of the two
                electrodes, the dry electrodes come in direct contact
                 with the skin, but the floating electrodes use an
                 electrolytic gel as a chemical interface between the
                 skin and the metallic part of the electrode.</p>

          <p>This project introduced us to the important topics of
             Tiva™ TM4C129ENCPDT Microcontroller and its architecture.
              Tiva™ C Series ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller has been used
               herein the EMG detector that is TM4C129ENCPDT.
               The microcontroller has an inbuilt ADC and a memory
                that is used to convert the analog EMG signal into
                digital form and store it. Also, the analog signal
                was given to the Microcontroller and the graph was plotted.</p>
          <p>The software implementation of the analog circuit was built
            and studied using the Proteus design suite 8.6, further on
            the interfacing of the Microcontroller with the analog circuit
             was done to complete the hardware of the circuit. Energia IDE
              was used to interface the microcontroller with the analog circuit</p>

          <p>Our project is a cheap and portable device that
            can be used in the future by doctors as they can
            be easily carried. Since the project is not yet completed,
             it can be further completed in the coming time and more
              advancement can be brought to the device by introducing
               a database system. The database system can collect the
                data of patients which will help the doctors to contact
                 and treat them. Also if there are any glitches or bugs
                  in the device they can be removed in the future after
                  more testing</p>
